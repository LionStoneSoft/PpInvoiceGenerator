Hello! :)

Here's some extra information:

I used the code in paypoint_db.sql in MySQL to generate the database and populate it with information.

Within the DbConnection class, change the UID and PWD to the SQL user.

In the Program class, change the for loop amount depending on the amount of customers in the customers table.

The invoices generated will be placed in C:\generatedpdf which will need to be created, visual studio also needs to be run in administrator mode.

NuGet packages used:

HtmlRenderer.Core
HtmlRenderer.PdfSharp
MySql.Data
System.Text.Encoding.CodePages

Please let me know if you need any more information.

Thanks!
